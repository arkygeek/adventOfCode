    let's break down the problem into smaller steps:
    Parse the input data in each 'game' to
        (a) extract the game ID and
        (b) the sets of cubes revealed
    For each game:
        (1) check if any set of cubes revealed exceeds the given number of
            cubes of that color (12 red, 13 green, 14 blue).
            * If it does, the game is not possible.
        (2) If all sets of cubes revealed in a game are possible,
            add the game ID to the sum.
